# Introduction
A collection of scrapers, crawlers, and spiders, built on top of [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/). I've built this as an exercise to get to know Python better and to collect data that I can feed to machine learning and natural language processing algorithms.

Currently it features one scraper, which can be used for [discourse fora](discourse_forum).

# Installation
Install Python, go to the repo directory, and run `pip install requirements.txt -r`
